            <p>My name is Garry Maghari and welcome to my bio page! I mostly grew up in Los Angeles and studied Political Science in college.  What very little experience I have in programming was an intro computer science course I took in college where I learned(and mostly forgot) how to design a very basic webpage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am very excited to be starting this journey in web development.  There will be a lot of challenges with countless hours of confusion and frustration, followed by moments of banging my head on my desk with feelings for self-doubt but I am trusting the process.  With the help of my instructors, fellow classmates, and some help from Google and YouTube, I believe this will be a very rewarding experience.</p>
